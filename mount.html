            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There’s always been a craze in me to become an entrepreneur, which field I
            don’t know, but I just want to become a job-provider and torch-bearer of innovation. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I got this realization of why just the thought-process may seem productive and attractive, it
            really won’t take me too far. The problem being that, there I say it, it isn’t easy to become an
            entrepreneur. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;How do you define a Start-Up idea? <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we are talking of the intensive start-ups like opening another shop, a restaurant or starting another
            company; the spirit of Start-Up lies in Innovation. What gap in the industry are you trying to fill? What
            product do you think would solve some lingering problem in a more optimized way? Innovation and creativity
            is at the core of a start-up. So, this begs the question - how do I get these ideas? <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, allow me to tell the background of some of the most prolific entrepreneurs of the generation. <br>
            <img src="https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/getty_962120488_200014382000928098_434049.jpg" alt="mark zuckerberg" class="imgage">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Mark Zuckerberg – Mark was introduced to computers very early in his life, he was taught the skills of
            programming since he was 14. He used to create games at the age where his peers used to play. At Harvard as
            well, he was called a ‘programming prodigy’. Is it any wonder then, that he is today the man behind
            Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp? <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Jack Dorsey – Before developing Twitter and Square, Jack at age 14, got an interest in Dispatch-Routing
            and was further responsible for dispatch logistic algorithms that are used by companies like Uber, to this
            day. Is it then, a surprise to see him where he is? <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’d see countless more examples like these. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs were all at the top of the field,
            before making their fortunes. This proves that, innovation comes after expertise. The expertise of the field
            allows you to look at the gaps there may exist, on which you can work upon. <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider every field of study as a mountain and all the surrounding area as the scope of the field. Now in
            order to identify the big gaps in the area, I would have to climb that mountain of knowledge as far as I can
            to look for what’s missing in the market. It may be a simple repo-problem or a complex-but-doable algorithm
            needs to be implemented. The only way to find out, is to climb! <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, to all the wannabe entrepreneurs out there, it’s important to be at the top of the climb, to
            see what holes you can fill, and the knowledge you gain during the trek is your weapon to pack those holes
            up. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;So, good-luck on your adventure!
