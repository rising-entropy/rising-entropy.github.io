                class="imgage">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ever since the invasion of the Galwan Valley took place by the Chinese Military,
            there has been a bellow of unrest throughout the nation. Angry Protestants have gone so far as to destroy
            shops selling Chinese products. There is indeed a wave of unrest in the country. This has also been followed
            by the uproar to boycott all Chinese Products and hence potentially threaten the Chinese Economy. I would
            like to put my two cents on the topic. <br>
            <img src="images/stat.PNG" alt="stats" class="imgage">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let’s start by understanding what impact would China have if India stops all
            imports from China. China exports roughly $68bn worth of goods, while its global export is around $2.49tn
            (2018). Which means that India accounts for only 2.73% of their total export. This amount is very nominal
            for a growing economy of China. While, incessant boycotting like this would prove catastrophic to us
            Indians. <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are enormously dependent on China for Chemicals, Fuels, Technology, Medical
            equipment, Cotton, etc. That is, all our sectors are in some-way or the other, dependent on the Chinese.
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These facts beg the question, is boycotting China really a good idea? Isn’t this
            going to hurt us more than them? <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, the answer is a resounding NO! It’s foolish to act in rage over the
            events, we tend to find solace in acting rashly, seldom thinking of the long-term consequences. Instead, I
            propose a long-term plan, one that would massively benefit us and destroy the Chinese from the very spine.
            <br>

                alt="industries" class="imgage">
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We must initiate a movement to create the products in-house, with very high R&D
            and dynamic in scale. These products must directly compete with price and quality of that of the Chinese
            goods. For this, we desperately need high-quality talent, expensive machinery and some highly-driven
            entrepreneurs. Sectors of Electronic goods, chemicals and high-end machinery must be revolutionized. This
            movement may take a long time to reach its goal, but this is one way in which we can truly emerge
            victorious. <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This idea has been previously performed on 2-wheeler automobiles. Check this
            really great article I found:

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; India is a land of raw youth talent. This energy is pointless without the right
            direction. The youth must dream to be the leaders of change, to kindle the fire of home-grown innovation and
            be the providers of the world. Protests and causing riots aren’t going to take us anywhere. This is
            therefore a call-to-action to all the readers, to work towards a revolution, to put our vigour in the right
            direction. And this would be the sweetest revenge we can give to China – replace their domination! <br>
