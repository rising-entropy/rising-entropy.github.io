            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one is going to be a bit personal for me. I am a single child to my
            parents and hence had no siblings to be with. Both of my parents used to work, so I spent my days till age 9
            at baby-sitters. I was bullied and beaten-up as a child around age 7, after which my parents didn’t allow me
            to play with other kids in the building. These things led me to become largely uninterested to talk with
            others. The only people who I talked freely were my parents. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know how in school, all students sit together in their groups, chat and
            play together? And there’s some kids, who sit alone in some corner or below the stairs to eat alone? I was
            the latter kid for a large part of school-life. No one came to talk to me, neither did I had the motivation
            for courage to approach first. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somethings then started to change since I believe age 9. There had been a
            change in curriculum of the State board. Schools now had to include group-projects, extracurricular
            activities for the students. And a major credit of my change in attitude has to go to that. <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a project, our English teacher divided us into groups to perform a skit on
            a story with moral. She then distributed us into groups. This skit, from its ideation to execution was fun
            and evolving, I now found a group and my first friends through this and other activities. My ma encouraged
            me to take part in more social events like the annual-day, sports-day and even inter-school competitions. By
            then, I had acquired skills to occupy the stage with a group and perform. But, the scare of going there
            alone with the entire school assembly (1500 students) watching was nothing less than a night-mare. <br>
            <img src="https://scontent.fpnq10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/560993_514721618544078_1515551128_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&_nc_sid=85a577&_nc_oc=AQnVporrd2yNGWBXSUFpx-7UyZ-O2gblwOluZvqAEgbTacPwIM9ku3jLiKD3x7_8M6o&_nc_ht=scontent.fpnq10-1.fna&oh=fd940b426aa1e4b1bb3db6ab45ef1499&oe=5F24EF9F" alt="assembly" class="imgage">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our school, there’s this system in place that every week, a class has the
            responsibility to send 3 students every day to present a story or article, a thought of the day, and
            important news. Every Wednesday is the ground-assembly while on other days, it takes place in the class. In
            6th grade, it was our turn to present, I had decided against taking part in this due to the stage-fear.
            Wednesday came and all of us had lined-up in the assembly, height-wise, chatting about. The assembly prayers
            may begin any minute now. All of a sudden, our class-teacher comes up to me, says- the guy who was to
            present a story is absent, and it’s a ground assembly so it has to presented. Prepare any story and present
            it on stage. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was crazy-shocked at this. Time for one of my biggest nightmares to be true,
            and I go in completely unprepared! I cared about my grades way too much to say no to this. Took up the
            courage and went up. As the prayers and pledges were ongoing, thought of telling a story I had read in
            Tinkle the last night, formulated it, and went forward. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story went alright it seemed, neither mam nor the ones I asked had any
            complaints (or maybe they didn’t say anything to my face, I’d never know). But that day was a memorable one
            for me. After this I had no reason to be scared of speaking to the crowd. And today, after many elocutions,
            lots of speeches, and numerous anchoring opportunities, as I write this, I truly understand the consequence
            of that one change in curriculum. I’ve also learnt that to truly overcome your fears, you need to be pushed.
            Because once you do that leap of faith, ain’t no one gonna stop you! <br>
